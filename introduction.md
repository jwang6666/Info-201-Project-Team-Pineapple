### What Does Our Web Application Do?
Our Project aims to find out how factors such as time, location, unemployment rate, average rent, cocaine arrests and consumer index price of food correlate to violent crimes in Seattle. During our projects, we are seeking answers for questions like :

1. Which place in Seattle had the most robbery cases in 2015?
2. How average rent influences violent crime in Seattle? 
3. How violent crimes will change by the change of unemployment rate?

We use map, scattergraph, and table to provide a clear data visualization for our audience.  

1. Users can look at locations of a specific type of violent crime happened in a specific period of time on the `Map` by adjusting `Time(Year)` and `Type of Crime`.  
2. Users can also find out the correlation between a specific factor and violent crimes in `Correlated Factors` by using `Select Factor`. 
3. We includes a `Regression Table` with statistic analyses of how the four factors are correlated to violent crimes in Seattle.

### Where Did Our Data Come From?

Our team gathered data from various sources:

1. Violent crimes, crime location, and illegal drug arrests were gathered from the [Seattle Police Department website](https://www.seattle.gov/police/information-and-data)
2. unemployment rate, Seattle population, homeless population, high school graduation rate, and median household income were collected from [US census bureau](https://www.census.gov/data.html), [Seattle Government website](http://www.seattle.gov/services-and-information), and [Talkpoverty.org](https://talkpoverty.org/state-year-report/washington-2017-report/)
